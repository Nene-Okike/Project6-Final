# Project6
In this project, we will have the hands-on experience that showcases Three-tier Architecture while also ensuring that the disks used to store files on the Linux servers are adequately partitioned and managed through programs such as gdisk and LVM respectively.

We are to prepare storage infrastructure on two Linux servers and implement a basic web solution using WordPress which is a free and open-source content management system written in PHP and paired with MySQL as its backend Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
